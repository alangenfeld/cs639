# v0

## right now mostly working:
*	1 chunk per file
*	1 server per chunk
*	chunks phone master on launch
*	client queries master, receives chunk ID and server addr
*	client can write and read chunks
*	master distributes chunks across chunks

## todo:
*	switch from http to tcp RPC calls
*	multiple chunks per file
*	...
*	profit!
